# Luke's LaTeX Templates and Build Files

A couple people on YouTube have asked me for my LaTeX templates, so I'm pushing them here. You can also find my compiled bibliography sheet.

Most of them, like the article template, really aren't too different from the normal LaTeX form, but call all the packages I use on a daily basis.

So far I have templates for the following:
+ An article/term paper template
+ Beamer with typical formatting
+ Beamer with unique dark and colorful formatting
+ A syllabus template
+ A handout template
+ My CV/résumé
+ The glossa stylesheet for biblatex
+ My (big) bibliography file

(Preview images coming.)

Of course, now that these are on Github, I'll probably be beautifying them a bit as I go on.

By the way, the bibliography file might not be super useful, unless you already know my tags (just `lastname04`, etc.), although you might want to look at it for form. I guess if you're a linguist as well, it could be pratical anyway.
