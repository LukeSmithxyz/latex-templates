``In Bhart{\ud{r}}hari's view, then, the primary linguistic fact is the undivided sentence-\textit{sphota}. Just as a bare root has no meaning in the world, so also the meanings of individual words are merely hints or stepping stones to the meaning of the sentence. This is a plain linguistic fact, which has none the less been clear to very few philosophers, either in India or elsewhere; and though familiar enough in modern linguistics, is still constantly overlooked in many discussions on meaning.''
408``Bhart{\ud{r}}hari, like Pata{\~n}jali, starts from the observation that the word can be considered under two aspects, as sound, or as meaning-bearer.''
(The fact that the sound is produced serially is no argument for considering the \textit{spho{\ud{t}}a} to be (capable of predicates) `before' or `after': having no order itself, it is only apparently perceived under the disguise of order and as possessing parts.)

``
It is a miserable story.
Man seeks a principle through which he can despise man.
He invents a world so as to be able to slander and bespatter this world.
In reality, he reaches every time for nothingness, and construes this nothingness as God, as truth and in any case a judge and condemner of this state of being.
The history of philosophy is a secret raging against the preconditions of life
and the value-feelings of life,
against partisanship in favor of life.
Philosophers have never hesitated to affirm a higher world provided it contradicted this world, and furnished them with a pretext for speaking ill of this world.
It has been hitherto the grand school of slander.
''


``The aberration of philosophy is that, instead of seeing logic and the categories of reason as means toward the adjustment of the world for utilitarian ends (basically involving an expedient falsification), one believed one possessed in them the criterion of truth and reality.
Instead of employing them as a tool to make the world manageable and calculable, the madness of philosophers imagined that in these categories it presented the concept of another `true' world, to which the one in which man lives does not correspond.
This is the greatest error that has ever been comitted.
[...]
One believed one possssed a criterion of reality in the form of reason, while in fact, one possessed them in order to become master of reality.
In order to misunderstand reality in a shrewd manner.
And behold, now this world came to seem false, and precisely on account of the properties that contitute its reality: change, becoming, multiplicity, opposition, contradiction, war.
And then, the entire fatal error was there.
